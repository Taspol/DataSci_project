# Data Science Project: Pipeline for Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Visualization

Welcome to the **Data Science Pipeline** project! This application demonstrates the seamless integration of:

- **Data Engineering (DE)**: Efficiently preprocess and clean data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Build, train, and evaluate predictive models.
- **Visualization (Viz)**: Present insights through interactive charts and dashboards.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Streamline workflows** by automating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
2. **Promote interpretability** through meaningful visualizations of both raw and processed data.
3. **Demonstrate scalability** in handling datasets of varying sizes and complexities.

## Key Features
- **Data Engineering**: 
  - Handle missing data, outliers, and transformations.
  - Data integration and feature extraction pipelines.

- **Machine Learning**: 
  - Explore models such as linear regression, classification, clustering, and more.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.

- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive plots and dashboards for data exploration.
  - Model performance metrics and trend analysis.
